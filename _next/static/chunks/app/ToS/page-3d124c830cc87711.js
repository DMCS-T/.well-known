This Agreement is the parties’ entire agreement on this subject and merges and supersedes all related prior and contemporaneous agreements. By agreeing to these terms, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept this Agreement, and you also agree to be bound by its terms. This Agreement applies to all Orders entered into under this Agreement. Capitalized terms have the meanings given under “Definitions.” Microsoft has created this template Standard Contract to facilitate a transaction between Publisher and Customer. Both parties acknowledge that Microsoft is not a party to this Agreement, nor in anyway responsible for the parties’ actions or obligations under this Agreement. Microsoft’s relationship with Customer and Publisher is solely governed by Microsoft’s respective agreements with those parties; Microsoft otherwise disclaims all liability resulting from this Agreement (including any Orders). 1. LICENSE TO OFFERINGS 1.1 License grant. Offerings are licensed and not sold. Upon acceptance of an Order, and subject to Customer’s compliance with this Agreement, Publisher grants Customer a nonexclusive and limited license to use the ordered Offerings. These licenses are solely for Customer’s own use and business purposes and are nontransferable except as expressly permitted under this Agreement or applicable law.

Any use of those components may be subject to additional terms and conditions and Customer agrees that any applicable licenses governing the use of the components will be incorporated by reference in this Agreement. 1.2 Duration of licenses. Licenses granted on a subscription basis expire at the end of the applicable subscription period set forth in the Order, unless renewed.

Publisher reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. Offerings are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and international treaties. No rights will be granted or implied by waiver or estoppel. Rights to access or use Offerings on a device do not give Customer any right to implement Publisher’s patents or other intellectual property in the device itself or in any other software or devices. 1.6 Restrictions.

PRIVACY 2.1 EU Standard Contractual Clauses. To the extent applicable, the parties will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. All transfers of Customer Data out of the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses, as designated by the European Commission, made available by the Publisher at the applicable URL for such terms or as otherwise communicated to Customer. 2.2 Personal Data. Customer consents to the processing of Personal Data by Publisher and its Affiliates, and their respective agents and Subcontractors, as provided in this Agreement. Before providing Personal Data to Publisher, Customer will obtain all required consents from third parties (including Customer’s contacts, partners, distributors, administrators, and employees) under applicable privacy and Data Protection Laws. 2.3 Processing of Personal Data; GDPR. To the extent Publisher is a processor or subprocessor of Personal Data subject to the GDPR, the Standard Contractual Clauses govern that processing and the parties also agree to the following terms in this subsection (“Processing of Personal Data; GDPR”): a. Processor and Controller Roles and Responsibilities. Customer and Publisher agree that Customer is the controller of Personal Data and Publisher is the processor of such data, except when (a) Customer acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case Publisher is a subprocessor or (b) stated otherwise in any Offering-specific terms. Publisher will process Personal Data only on documented instructions from Customer. In any instance where the GDPR applies and Customer is a processor, Customer warrants to Publisher that Customer’s instructions, including appointment of Processor as a processor or subprocessor, have been authorized by the relevant controller. b. Processing Details. The parties acknowledge and agree that: i. the subject-matter of the processing is limited to Personal Data within the scope of the GDPR; ii. the duration of the processing will be for the duration of the Customer’s right to use the Offering and until all Personal Data is deleted or returned in accordance with Customer instructions or the terms of this Agreement; iii. the nature and purpose of the processing will be to provide the Offering pursuant to this Agreement; iv. the types of Personal Data processed by the Offering include those expressly identified in Article 4 of the GDPR; and v. the categories of data subjects are Customer’s representatives and end users, such as employees, contractors, collaborators, and customers, and other data subjects whose Personal Data is contained within any data made available to Publisher by Customer. c. Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests.

Publisher will comply with reasonable requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request. If Publisher receives a request from Customer’s data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the GDPR in connection with an Offering for which Publisher is a data processor or subprocessor, Publisher will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to Customer. Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Offering. Publisher will comply with reasonable requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request. d. Use of Subprocessors. Customer consents to Publisher using the subprocessors listed at the applicable Publisher URL or as otherwise communicated to Customer. Publisher remains responsible for its subprocessors’ compliance with the obligations herein. Publisher may update its list of subprocessors from time to time, by providing Customer at least 14 days notice before providing any new subprocessor with access to Personal Data. If Customer does not approve of any such changes, Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Offering without penalty by providing, prior to expiration of the notice period, written notice of termination that includes an explanation of the grounds for non-approval. e. Records of Processing Activities. Publisher will maintain all records required by Article 30(2) of the GDPR and, to the extent applicable to the processing of Personal Data on behalf of Customer, make them available to Customer upon request. 2.4 Security. Publisher will take appropriate security measures that are required by Data Protection Laws and in accordance with good industry practice relating to data security. 2.5 Support Data.

Publisher will not use Support Data for any other purpose unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties. 3. CONFIDENTIALITY 3.1 Non-Disclosure Agreement. The parties will treat all confidential information exchanged between the parties under this Agreement in accordance with the separate nondisclosure agreement (“NDA”) executed by the parties. If no separate NDA is in effect, the following provisions apply to the parties’ exchange of confidential information. 3.2 Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” is non-public information that is designated “confidential” or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential, including, but not limited to, Customer Data, Support Data, the terms of this Agreement, and Customer’s account authentication credentials. Confidential Information does not include information that: (1) becomes publicly available without a breach of a confidentiality obligation; (2) the receiving party received lawfully from another source without a confidentiality obligation; (3) is independently developed; or (4) is a comment or suggestion volunteered about the other party’s business, products, or services. 3.3 Protection of Confidential Information. Each party will take reasonable steps to protect the other’s Confidential Information and will use the other party’s Confidential Information only for purposes of the parties’ business relationship. Neither party will disclose Confidential Information to third parties, except to its Representatives, and then only on a need-to-know basis under nondisclosure obligations at least as protective as this Agreement. Each party remains responsible for the use of Confidential Information by its Representatives and, in the event of discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure, must promptly notify the other party. 3.4 Disclosure required by law. A party may disclose the other’s Confidential Information if required by law, but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) to enable the other party to seek a protective order. 3.5 Duration of Confidentiality obligation. These obligations apply: (1) for Customer Data, until it is deleted by Publisher; and (2) for all other Confidential Information, for a period of five years after a party receives the Confidential Information. 4. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA) Publisher may offer further availability and support obligations for an Offering. Such service level agreement (“SLA”) will be made available by the Publisher at the applicable URL for such SLA or as otherwise communicated to Customer. 5. VERIFYING COMPLIANCE 5.1 Customer must keep records relating to Offerings it and its Affiliates use or distribution. At Publisher’s expense, Publisher may verify Customer’s and its Affiliates’ compliance with this Agreement by directing an independent auditor (under nondisclosure obligations) to conduct an audit or ask Customer to complete a self-audit process. Customer must promptly provide any information and documents that Publisher or the auditor reasonably requests related to the verification and access to systems running the Offerings. If verification or self-audit reveals any unlicensed use, Customer must order sufficient licenses to cover the period of its unlicensed use. The audits may be conducted more frequently, if required by the party’s auditors and/or regulators, of books and records related to this Agreement. The expenses for all such audit will be borne by the party conducting the audit. All information and reports related to the verification process will be Confidential Information and used solely to verify compliance. 5.2 Upon request, Publisher will make available to Customer all information necessary to conduct an audit and demonstrate compliance under GDPR provisions for the processing of Personal Data.
