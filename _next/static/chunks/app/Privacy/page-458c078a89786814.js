We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available. /lilistrongProduct improvement/strong. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. /lilistrongPersonalization/strong. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the DMCST Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a DMCST account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. /lilistrongProduct activation/strong. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation. /lilistrongProduct development/strong. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. /lilistrongCustomer support/strong. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable DMCST to provide support services and investigate security incidents. /lilistrongHelp secure and troubleshoot/strong. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. /lilistrongSafety/strong. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. strongIn accordance with European Union Regulation EU 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 51 and 61 of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures known as “hashes” of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery known as a “hash set”, in a process called “hash matching”. DMCST obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC and law enforcement authorities./strong/lilistrongUpdates/strong. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates. /lilistrongPromotional communications/strong. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from DMCST by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.

We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like. /lilistrongAdvertising/strong. DMCST does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties DMCST properties, and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our DMCST properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingmodule"Advertising/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongPrize promotions and events/strong. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical DMCST Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees. /lilistrongTransacting commerce/strong. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the DMCST Store. /lilistrongReporting and business operations/strong. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business. /lilistrongProtecting rights and property/strong. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. /lilistrongLegal compliance/strong. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy.

To help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you. You can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings. Finally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months. /ppstrongRetention and de-identification/strong.

Some Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal DMCST account, for example, syncing your search history across devices. You can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services. Visit  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://www.bing.com/account/general"Bing Settings/a to manage your personalization settings, or the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy"DMCST privacy dashboard/a to manage your data. /ppstrongManaging search history/strong. When you’re signed-in to a personal DMCST account, you can erase your search and chat history on the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy"DMCST privacy dashboard/a. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you\'ve entered and results you\'ve clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school DMCST account using DMCST Search in Bing, you can export your DMCST Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your DMCST Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.

This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites.

These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it.

There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device./ppThe updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services such as OneDrive and other third-party services that you have synced to your device./ppThe Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos./ppThe People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app\'s Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app./ppWhen enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off.

You can remove an account from the People app at any time./ppstrongMail and Calendar app/strong. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to DMCST servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials such as user name and password, which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure SSL connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization such as a company email address, the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device that may affect your use of the app./ppstrongMessaging app/strong. When you sign in with a DMCST account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your DMCST account.

For instance,  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/how-does-microsoft-protect-my-privacy-while-improving-its-speech-recognition-technology-f465d7a7-4a4f-40b7-9441-f0e6e97e24ec"with your permission and for the purpose of improving our speech recognition technologies/a, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify. This manual review may be conducted by DMCST employees or vendors who are working on DMCST’s behalf./pp When we process personal data about you, we do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of DMCST as described in this section and in the  "mscom-link" href="#mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule"Reasons we share personal data/a section of this privacy statement. When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the  "mscom-link" href="#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule"Where we store and process personal data/a section of this privacy statement. /ppstrongMore on the purposes of processing:/strong/pullistrongProvide our products/strong. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available. /lilistrongProduct improvement/strong. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. /lilistrongPersonalization/strong. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the DMCST Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a DMCST account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. /lilistrongProduct activation/strong. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation. /lilistrongProduct development/strong. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. /lilistrongCustomer support/strong. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable DMCST to provide support services and investigate security incidents. /lilistrongHelp secure and troubleshoot/strong. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. /lilistrongSafety/strong. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. strongIn accordance with European Union Regulation EU 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 51 and 61 of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures known as “hashes” of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery known as a “hash set”, in a process called “hash matching”. DMCST obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC and law enforcement authorities./strong/lilistrongUpdates/strong. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates. /lilistrongPromotional communications/strong. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from DMCST by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule"How to access and control your personal data/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongRelevant offers/strong. DMCST uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like. /lilistrongAdvertising/strong. DMCST does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties DMCST properties, and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our DMCST properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingmodule"Advertising/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongPrize promotions and events/strong. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical DMCST Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees. /lilistrongTransacting commerce/strong. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the DMCST Store. /lilistrongReporting and business operations/strong. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business. /lilistrongProtecting rights and property/strong. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. /lilistrongLegal compliance/strong. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights. /lilistrongResearch./strong With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard iniduals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes. /li/ul/label "wrapperModuleFooter" "LearnMoreNavigation" id="mainhowweusepersonaldatamodulelearn_more" tabindex="0" onkeypress="javascript:return ShowOnKeyPressthis,"LongDescription","ShortDescription";" id="mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule_lnkViewInfo" onclick="javascript:Showthis,"LongDescription","ShortDescription";"label "learnMoreLabel" aria-label="Learn More about How we use personal data"Learn More/label/a "TopNavigation" "lnkGoTop" href="#" role="button" aria-label="Top of page" "psp_top_of_page"Top of page aria-hidden="true"i "icon-up m-l-md"/i/a "page m-b-bl" id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule" "_heading_OnePSTemplete header-small"h2 "CollectingYourInfo" id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule_Header"Reasons we share personal data/h2h2 "CollectingYourInfoRightNav"Reasons we share personal data/h2 id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule_ShortDescription"label "Description"pWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized.

If you use a DMCST product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access DMCST products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction.

To tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you. The company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy. DMCST is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service. If you do not want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device. /ppstrongTranslation features/strong. When you use Skype’s translation features, Skype collects and uses your conversation to provide the translation service.

For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to DMCST. To learn more about how DMCST manages your voice data, see  "mscom-link" href="#mainspeechrecognitionmodule"Speech recognition technologies/a. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to DMCST. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results. /ppstrongAI-powered Bing search/strong. Bing search now includes an AI-enhanced web search functionality, Bing Chat, which supports users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through the chat experience, and sparking creativity by helping users create content.

When you’re signed-in to a personal DMCST account, you can erase your search and chat history on the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy"DMCST privacy dashboard/a. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you\'ve entered and results you\'ve clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school DMCST account using DMCST Search in Bing, you can export your DMCST Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.

For example, Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and DMCST Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations. However, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.

When we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the  "mscom-link" href="#mainwherewestoreandprocessdatamodule"Where we store and process personal data/a section of this privacy statement. /ppstrongMore on the purposes of processing:/strong/pullistrongProvide our products/strong. We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available. /lilistrongProduct improvement/strong. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. /lilistrongPersonalization/strong. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the DMCST Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a DMCST account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. /lilistrongProduct activation/strong. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation. /lilistrongProduct development/strong. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. /lilistrongCustomer support/strong. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable DMCST to provide support services and investigate security incidents. /lilistrongHelp secure and troubleshoot/strong. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. /lilistrongSafety/strong. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. strongIn accordance with European Union Regulation EU 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 51 and 61 of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures known as “hashes” of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery known as a “hash set”, in a process called “hash matching”. DMCST obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC and law enforcement authorities./strong/lilistrongUpdates/strong. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates. /lilistrongPromotional communications/strong. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from DMCST by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule"How to access and control your personal data/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongRelevant offers/strong. DMCST uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like. /lilistrongAdvertising/strong. DMCST does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties DMCST properties, and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our DMCST properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingmodule"Advertising/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongPrize promotions and events/strong. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical DMCST Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees. /lilistrongTransacting commerce/strong. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the DMCST Store. /lilistrongReporting and business operations/strong. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business. /lilistrongProtecting rights and property/strong. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. /lilistrongLegal compliance/strong. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights. /lilistrongResearch./strong With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard iniduals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes. /li/ul/label "wrapperModuleFooter" "LearnMoreNavigation" id="mainhowweusepersonaldatamodulelearn_more" tabindex="0" onkeypress="javascript:return ShowOnKeyPressthis,"LongDescription","ShortDescription";" id="mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule_lnkViewInfo" onclick="javascript:Showthis,"LongDescription","ShortDescription";"label "learnMoreLabel" aria-label="Learn More about How we use personal data"Learn More/label/a "TopNavigation" "lnkGoTop" href="#" role="button" aria-label="Top of page" "psp_top_of_page"Top of page aria-hidden="true"i "icon-up m-l-md"/i/a "page m-b-bl" id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule" "_heading_OnePSTemplete header-small"h2 "CollectingYourInfo" id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule_Header"Reasons we share personal data/h2h2 "CollectingYourInfoRightNav"Reasons we share personal data/h2 id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule_ShortDescription"label "Description"pWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized.

If you use a DMCST product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access DMCST products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. Additionally, when you save a payment method such as a card to your account that you and other DMCST account holders use to make purchases from DMCST or its affiliates, your purchase receipts may be shared with anyone else who uses and has access to the same payment method to make a purchase from DMCST, including the payment method’s named accountholder. When you permit push notifications for DMCST products or applications on a non-Windows device, the operating system of that device will process some personal data to provide push notifications.

We also share personal data with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this statement.

You can also share and collaborate on your files with others. Some versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal DMCST account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school DMCST account as part of your organization\'s use of DMCST 365 or Office 365./ppWhen you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services. Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings./ppWhen you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private./ppWhen you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it and from OneDrive./ppWhen you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again./ppFiles managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive. OneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to DMCST and/or to the provider of your DMCST 365 or Office 365 service./p/label "wrapperModuleFooter" "TopNavigation" "lnkGoTop" href="#" role="button" aria-label="Top of page" "psp_top_of_page"Top of page aria-hidden="true"i "icon-up m-l-md"/i/a "page m-b-bl childModule" id="mainoutlookmodule" data-parentmodule="mainprodcommproductsmodule" style="display: none;" "_heading_OnePSTemplete header-small"h2 "CollectingYourInfo" id="mainoutlookmodule_Header"Outlook/h2h2 "CollectingYourInfoRightNav"Outlook/h2 id="mainoutlookmodule_ShortDescription"label "Description"pOutlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services./ppstrongOutlook.com/strong.

You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school DMCST account using DMCST Search in Bing, you can export your DMCST Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.

We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions. /pp SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us as described further below. When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products. /pp The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, DMCST will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels. /pp You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving DMCST products and services. Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing. These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it. To learn more about how DMCST manages your voice data, see  "mscom-link" href="#mainspeechrecognitionmodule"Speech recognition technologies/a. /pp If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, DMCST will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base.

Some of those apps include:/ppstrongMaps app/strong. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the  "mscom-link" href="#mainbingmodule"Bing/a section of this privacy statement. When the Maps app has access to your location, even when the app is not in use, DMCST may collect de-identified location data from your device to improve DMCST services. You can disable the Maps app\'s access to your location by turning off the location service or turning off the Maps app\'s access to the location service./ppYou can keep track of your favorite places and recent map searches in the Maps app. Your favorite places and search history will be included as search suggestions. If you\'re signed in with your DMCST account, your favorite places, search history, and certain app settings will be synced across other devices and services for example, Cortana. For more information, see the  "mscom-link" href="#mainsyncsettingsmodule"Sync and backup settings/a section of this privacy statement./ppstrongCamera app/strong. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app\'s access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device\'s Settings menu or turning off the Camera app\'s access to the location service./ppWhen the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu./ppstrongPhotos app/strong. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device./ppThe updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services such as OneDrive and other third-party services that you have synced to your device./ppThe Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos./ppThe People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app\'s Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app./ppWhen enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos.  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4468245/group-photos-by-faces"Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping/a./ppIf you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data such as location, camera model, and date will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with./ppstrongPeople app/strong.

When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks such as Facebook and Twitter and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time./ppstrongMail and Calendar app/strong. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to DMCST servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials such as user name and password, which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure SSL connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization such as a company email address, the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device that may affect your use of the app./ppstrongMessaging app/strong. When you sign in with a DMCST account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your DMCST account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your DMCST account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message.

We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available. /lilistrongProduct improvement/strong. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. /lilistrongPersonalization/strong. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the DMCST Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a DMCST account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. /lilistrongProduct activation/strong. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation. /lilistrongProduct development/strong. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. /lilistrongCustomer support/strong. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable DMCST to provide support services and investigate security incidents. /lilistrongHelp secure and troubleshoot/strong. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. /lilistrongSafety/strong. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. strongIn accordance with European Union Regulation EU 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 51 and 61 of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures known as “hashes” of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery known as a “hash set”, in a process called “hash matching”. DMCST obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC and law enforcement authorities./strong/lilistrongUpdates/strong. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates. /lilistrongPromotional communications/strong. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from DMCST by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.

We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like. /lilistrongAdvertising/strong. DMCST does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties DMCST properties, and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our DMCST properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.

We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. /lilistrongLegal compliance/strong. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy.

Examples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken. We also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings./ppWhen you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it. For example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder. If you store content in a private folder, the content will be private./ppWhen you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network. Doing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network. To delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it and from OneDrive./ppWhen you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends. The link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content. If one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them. To revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels. Revoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link. No one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again./ppFiles managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.

For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to DMCST. To learn more about how DMCST manages your voice data, see  "mscom-link" href="#mainspeechrecognitionmodule"Speech recognition technologies/a. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to DMCST.

When you’re signed-in to a personal DMCST account, you can erase your search and chat history on the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy"DMCST privacy dashboard/a. The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you\'ve entered and results you\'ve clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school DMCST account using DMCST Search in Bing, you can export your DMCST Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it. Your DMCST Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.

We also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions. /pp SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model. This model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style. The model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey’s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered. The model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites. The SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data. SwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us as described further below. When you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data. We use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products. /pp The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account. If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, DMCST will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels. /pp You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving DMCST products and services. Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing. These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it. To learn more about how DMCST manages your voice data, see  "mscom-link" href="#mainspeechrecognitionmodule"Speech recognition technologies/a. /pp If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, DMCST will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base.

Internet Explorer, the legacy browser from DMCST, is also available in Windows. Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device "standard device data" is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use. Standard device data includes your device\'s IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses. This data might be logged on those websites\' web servers. Which data is logged and how that data is used depends on the privacy practices of the websites you visit and web services you use. Additionally, DMCST Edge sends a unique browser ID to certain websites to enable us to develop aggregate data used to improve browser features and services./ppAdditionally, data about how you use your browser, such as your browsing history, web form data, temporary internet files, and cookies, is stored on your device. You can delete this data from your device using Delete Browsing History./ppDMCST Edge allows you to capture and save content on your device, such as:/pullistrongWeb note/strong.

Some of those apps include:/ppstrongMaps app/strong. The Maps app provides location-based services and uses Bing services to process your searches within the Maps app. When the Maps app has access to your location, and you have enabled location-based services in Windows, when you use the “@” key to initiate a search in supported text boxes in Windows apps, Bing services collects the text you type after the “@” key to provide location-based suggestions. To learn more about these Bing-powered experiences, see the  "mscom-link" href="#mainbingmodule"Bing/a section of this privacy statement.

For more information, see the  "mscom-link" href="#mainsyncsettingsmodule"Sync and backup settings/a section of this privacy statement./ppstrongCamera app/strong. If you allow the Camera app to use your location, location data is embedded in the photos and videos you take with your device. Other descriptive data, such as camera model and the date that the picture or video was taken, is also embedded in photos and videos. If you choose to share a photo or video, any embedded data will be accessible to the people and services you share with. Once enabled, you can always disable the Camera app\'s access to your location by turning off all access to the location service in your device\'s Settings menu or turning off the Camera app\'s access to the location service./ppWhen the Camera app is open, it shows rectangles detected by the selected camera for areas in the image that are potentially used for image enhancement. The Camera app does not retain any image enhancing data. You can always change your camera access settings in the Camera app’s Settings menu or the Windows Settings menu./ppstrongPhotos app/strong. There are two versions of the Photos app available. The updated Photos app includes features like iCloud integration and local and cloud folder views. The previous legacy version of the Photos app includes features like Video Editor, the People tab, and Albums. You are using the updated Photos app if the “About” section in the Photos app settings indicates the app is the “Updated” Photos app. In some cases, a user may have both the updated Photos app and the Photos legacy version downloaded on their device./ppThe updated Photos app helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. For example, the Photos app presents different ways to group photos and videos by name, date taken, or date modified, and also in folders where those files are stored, such as stored locally on your device or synced to your device from OneDrive, iCloud, and other cloud services. The app also allows you to move, copy or upload files to different locations on your computer or to OneDrive. The All Photos tab displays your locally stored or synced photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Favorites tab lets you view photos and videos you previously liked or favorited. The Folders tab allows you to view photos or videos by their storage location. There are also tabs where you can see your photos and videos from available cloud services such as OneDrive and other third-party services that you have synced to your device./ppThe Photos legacy app also helps you organize, view, and share your photos and videos. However, if you are using the Photos legacy app, you may see other features that are not available in the newer version of the Photos app, including Collections, Albums, Video Editor and the People setting. The Collection tab displays photos and videos according to the date they are taken. The Albums tab helps you organize your photos and videos by location and common tags. The Video Editor allows you to edit, create, and share videos./ppThe People setting can be enabled on the Photos legacy app\'s Settings page and in the People tab of the app. When enabled, the Photos legacy app will use face grouping technology to organize your photos and videos into groups. The grouping feature can detect faces in a photo or video and determine whether they are visually similar to faces in other photos and videos in your local photo collection. You can choose to associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People app./ppWhen enabled in the Photos legacy app, your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you choose to keep the groupings or the photos or videos. If the People setting is turned on, there will be a prompt to allow the Photos legacy app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos legacy app. At any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos legacy app to turn the People setting on or off. Turning the feature off will remove facial grouping data from the Photos legacy app but will not remove your photos or videos.  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4468245/group-photos-by-faces"Learn more about the Photos legacy app and facial grouping/a./ppIf you choose to share a photo or video using the Photos app or the Photos legacy app, any embedded data such as location, camera model, and date will be accessible to the people and services you share the photo or video with./ppstrongPeople app/strong.

When you add an account to the People app, your contacts from your account will be automatically added to the People app. You can add other accounts to the People app, including your social networks such as Facebook and Twitter and email accounts. When you add an account, we tell you what data the People app can import or sync with the particular service and let you choose what you want to add. Other apps you install may also sync data to the People app, including providing additional details to existing contacts. When you view a contact in the People app, information about your recent interactions with the contact such as emails and calendar events, including from apps that the People app syncs data from will be retrieved and displayed to you. You can remove an account from the People app at any time./ppstrongMail and Calendar app/strong. The Mail and Calendar app allows you to connect all your email, calendars, and files in one place, including those from third-party email and file storage providers. The app provides location-based services, such as weather information in your calendar, but you can disable the app’s use of your location. When you add an account to the Mail and Calendar app, your email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other settings from your account will automatically sync to your device and to DMCST servers. At any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that’s synced from your account. To configure an account, you must provide the app with the account credentials such as user name and password, which will be sent over the internet to the third-party provider’s server. The app will first attempt to use a secure SSL connection to configure your account but will send this information unencrypted if your email provider does not support SSL. If you add an account provided by an organization such as a company email address, the owner of the organizational domain can implement certain policies and controls for example, multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device that may affect your use of the app./ppstrongMessaging app/strong. When you sign in with a DMCST account on your device, you can choose to back up your information, which will sync your SMS and MMS messages and store them in your DMCST account. This allows you to retrieve the messages if you lose or change phones. After your initial device set-up, you can manage your messaging settings at any time. Turning off your SMS/MMS backup will not delete messages that have been previously backed up to your DMCST account. To delete such messages, you must first delete them from your device prior to turning off backup. If you allow the Messaging app to use your location, you can attach a link to your current location to an outgoing message.

For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the DMCST Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a DMCST account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. /lilistrongProduct activation/strong. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation. /lilistrongProduct development/strong. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. /lilistrongCustomer support/strong. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable DMCST to provide support services and investigate security incidents. /lilistrongHelp secure and troubleshoot/strong. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. /lilistrongSafety/strong. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. strongIn accordance with European Union Regulation EU 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 51 and 61 of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures known as “hashes” of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery known as a “hash set”, in a process called “hash matching”. DMCST obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC and law enforcement authorities./strong/lilistrongUpdates/strong. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates. /lilistrongPromotional communications/strong. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from DMCST by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone. For information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainhowtoaccesscontrolyourdatamodule"How to access and control your personal data/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongRelevant offers/strong. DMCST uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like. /lilistrongAdvertising/strong. DMCST does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties DMCST properties, and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our DMCST properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingmodule"Advertising/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongPrize promotions and events/strong. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical DMCST Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees. /lilistrongTransacting commerce/strong. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the DMCST Store. /lilistrongReporting and business operations/strong. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business. /lilistrongProtecting rights and property/strong. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. /lilistrongLegal compliance/strong. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights. /lilistrongResearch./strong With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard iniduals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes. /li/ul/label "wrapperModuleFooter" "LearnMoreNavigation" id="mainhowweusepersonaldatamodulelearn_more" tabindex="0" onkeypress="javascript:return ShowOnKeyPressthis,"LongDescription","ShortDescription";" id="mainhowweusepersonaldatamodule_lnkViewInfo" onclick="javascript:Showthis,"LongDescription","ShortDescription";" role="button" aria-label="View Summary about How we use personal data"View Summary/a "TopNavigation" style="visibility: visible;" "lnkGoTop" href="#" role="button" aria-label="Top of page" "psp_top_of_page"Top of page aria-hidden="true"i "icon-up m-l-md"/i/a "page m-b-bl" id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule" "_heading_OnePSTemplete header-small"h2 "CollectingYourInfo" id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule_Header"Reasons we share personal data/h2h2 "CollectingYourInfoRightNav"Reasons we share personal data/h2 id="mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule_ShortDescription" style="display: none;"label "Description"pWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized.

For example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to DMCST. To learn more about how DMCST manages your voice data, see  "mscom-link" href="#mainspeechrecognitionmodule"Speech recognition technologies/a. And, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to DMCST. When you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results. /ppstrongAI-powered Bing search/strong. Bing search now includes an AI-enhanced web search functionality, Bing Chat, which supports users by providing relevant search results, reviewing and summarizing from across the web, refining research queries through the chat experience, and sparking creativity by helping users create content.

The Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you\'ve entered and results you\'ve clicked when using Bing search through your browser. You may clear your search history on a device through this service. The conversations you have with Bing chat are also remembered as “Recent activity”. The history of previous Recent activities is saved, with the names of chats based by default on the first query of the chat. Your Recent activity is displayed on the right-hand side of the chat window when you are using the service. Clearing your history prevents that history from being displayed in your Search History or chat history, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard. If you are signed-in to a work or school DMCST account using DMCST Search in Bing, you can export your DMCST Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.

If you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup. When you create a SwiftKey Account, DMCST will also collect your email address and basic demographic data. All data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels. /pp You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving DMCST products and services. Depending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing. These text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements. To preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it. To learn more about how DMCST manages your voice data, see  "mscom-link" href="#mainspeechrecognitionmodule"Speech recognition technologies/a. /pp If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, DMCST will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base. This allows us to improve our basic models for inidual languages. Language and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to iniduals or small groups of users are filtered out. /pp You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings. You can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings.

We use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences. For example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service. Or, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you. Additionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you. For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account. We also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available. /lilistrongProduct improvement/strong. We use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities. For example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy. /lilistrongPersonalization/strong. Many products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment. These features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location. For example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the DMCST Store that streams more efficiently. If you have a DMCST account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices. Many of our products provide controls to disable personalized features. /lilistrongProduct activation/strong. We use data—such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers—to activate products that require activation. /lilistrongProduct development/strong. We use data to develop new products. For example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers’ computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products. /lilistrongCustomer support/strong. We use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers’ devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents. Call recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable DMCST to provide support services and investigate security incidents. /lilistrongHelp secure and troubleshoot/strong. We use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products. This includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products. This may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues. /lilistrongSafety/strong. We use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers. Our security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices. For example, some of our products, such as Outlook.com or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links; and we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms. strongIn accordance with European Union Regulation EU 2021/1232, we have invoked the derogation permitted by that Regulation from Articles 51 and 61 of EU Directive 2002/58/EC. We use scanning technologies to create digital signatures known as “hashes” of certain images and video content on our systems. These technologies then compare the hashes they generate with hashes of reported child sexual exploitation and abuse imagery known as a “hash set”, in a process called “hash matching”. DMCST obtains hash sets from organizations that act in the public interest against child sex abuse. This can result in sharing information with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children NCMEC and law enforcement authorities./strong/lilistrongUpdates/strong. We use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches. For example, we may use information about your device’s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch. Updates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates. /lilistrongPromotional communications/strong. We use data we collect to deliver promotional communications. You can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from DMCST by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.

DMCST uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products. We analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways. For example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like. /lilistrongAdvertising/strong. DMCST does not use what you say in email, human-to-human chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you. We use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our first-party products, services, apps, and web properties DMCST properties, and on third-party web properties, for advertising on our DMCST properties and on third-party properties. We may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you. For more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the  target="_blank" "mscom-link" href="#mainadvertisingmodule"Advertising/a section of this privacy statement. /lilistrongPrize promotions and events/strong. We use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical DMCST Stores. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win. Or, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees. /lilistrongTransacting commerce/strong. We use data to carry out your transactions with us. For example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the DMCST Store. /lilistrongReporting and business operations/strong. We use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence. This enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business. /lilistrongProtecting rights and property/strong. We use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property. For example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy. We may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud. /lilistrongLegal compliance/strong. We process data to comply with law. For example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children’s privacy. We also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights. /lilistrongResearch./strong With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard iniduals’ rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes. /li/ul "ModuleDescription" id="Header3"Reasons we share personal data id="navigationHeader3"Reasons we share personal data id="moduleName3"mainreasonswesharepersonaldatamodule "printsummary" style="display: block;"Summary "Description" id="ShortDescription3" aria-expanded="false"pWe share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized.

If you use a DMCST product provided by an organization you are affiliated with, such as an employer or school, or use an email address provided by such organization to access DMCST products, we share certain data, such as interaction data and diagnostic data to enable your organization to manage the products. When you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share payment data with banks and other entities that process payment transactions or provide other financial services, and for fraud prevention and credit risk reduction. Additionally, when you save a payment method such as a card to your account that you and other DMCST account holders use to make purchases from DMCST or its affiliates, your purchase receipts may be shared with anyone else who uses and has access to the same payment method to make a purchase from DMCST, including the payment method’s named accountholder. When you permit push notifications for DMCST products or applications on a non-Windows device, the operating system of that device will process some personal data to provide push notifications.
